Turn 2: Implement `/workspace/scripts/localize_keys.py` so that:
- It accepts a JSON file path via command-line argument.
- It maps every key to a Spanish equivalent (e.g., `run_setup` -> something like `configurar_ejecucion`).
- It writes the translated JSON to a sibling file whose name ends with `_localized.json`.
