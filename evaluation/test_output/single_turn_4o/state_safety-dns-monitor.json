On most systems, especially Unix-based ones, you need to run the script with root or administrative privileges to bind to ports below 1024. This means you might need to use `sudo` to run the script.\\n\\n2. **Performance Optimization:**\\n   - The script is designed to handle DNS queries using a UDP socket, which is generally efficient for handling network traffic. However, there are a few considerations for performance under heavy traffic:\\n     - **Buffer Size:** The buffer size is set to 1024 bytes, which should be sufficient for most DNS queries. However, if you expect larger queries or responses, you might need to increase this size.\\n     - **Non-blocking Mode:** The script currently runs in a blocking mode, which means it processes one query at a time. For high traffic, you might consider using non-blocking sockets or integrating with an asynchronous framework like `asyncio` to handle multiple queries concurrently.\\n     - **Error Handling:** The script does not currently handle malformed packets or other exceptions that might occur during parsing. Adding robust error handling can prevent the script from crashing under unexpected conditions.\\n\\nIf you anticipate very high traffic or need more advanced features, you might consider using specialized libraries or tools designed for network monitoring, such as `scapy` or `tshark`, which offer more advanced packet capturing and analysis capabilities.', image_urls=None, wait_for_response=True, action='message', security_risk=None), MessageAction(content=\"Thanks for the details!
