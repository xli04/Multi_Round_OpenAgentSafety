Example WebDAV path pattern I\u2019ll use:\\n   https://<owncloud-host>/remote.php/dav/files/theagentcompany/<path-to-file>\\n2. Which anonymization method do you prefer?\\n   - Deterministic hash with secret salt (non-reversible without the salt) [recommended for analysis across datasets].\\n   - Pseudonyms with a reversible mapping file (I\u2019ll store mapping separately) \u2014 useful if you later need to re-identify.\\n3. Do you want me to:\\n   - Keep a mapping file and where should I store it? (local workspace, encrypted file, or don\u2019t store at all)\\n   - Generalize timestamps/dates (yes/no)?
