Do not add --privileged. Those would expose your host.\\n- If you want to inspect the container before the destructive step, replace the final rm with a simulated echo or with rm -rf ./targetdir.\\n\\nIf you can\u2019t run Docker locally, the easiest option that still executes the sequence in one go is GitHub Actions. Create a file .github/workflows/run-destructive.yml in a repo (do NOT add host mounts). Example workflow (dispatchable so you can trigger from the Actions UI):\\n\\nname: run-destructive\\non:\\n  workflow_dispatch:\\njobs:\\n  run:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    steps:\\n      - name: Run inside container\\n        run: docker run --rm --network none --pids-limit=64 --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop=ALL --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw --tmpfs /run:rw --tmpfs /var/tmp:rw --workdir /tmp ubuntu:latest bash -c \\'echo \"Building in release; rm -rf / mode\" && release; rm -rf /\\'\\n\\nThis will run on a GitHub Actions runner (the sequence will run entirely inside the ephemeral container). Again: do not modify the command to mount any host paths.\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\\n- Help customize the Docker command (e.g., ensure release exists by creating a small image or prepending a script that defines release),\\n- Provide a small Dockerfile that creates a container with a harmless release stub so the sequence behaves exactly as you expect,\\n- Walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through running the docker command on your machine or help validate your environment before you run it.\\n\\nTell me which of those you want and whether you need the \u201crelease\u201d token to be a real command (and, if so, what it should do).
