At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models\n(LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with\nand affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce\nOpenHands ( f.k.a. OpenDevin), a platform for the development of powerful and\nflexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human\ndeveloper: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the\nweb. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents,\nsafe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination\nbetween multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on\nour currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over\n15 challenging tasks, including software engineering ( e.g.,SWE-BENCH ) and web\nbrowsing ( e.g.,WEBARENA ), among others. Released under the permissive MIT\nlicense, OpenHands is a community project spanning academia and industry with\nmore than 2.1K contributions from over 188 contributors.\nCode https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands\nBenchmark https://hf.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation\nSlack http://bit.ly/OpenHands-Slack\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nPowered by large language models (LLMs; OpenAI 2024b; Team et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2024;\nChang et al. 2024), user-facing AI systems (such as ChatGPT) have become increasingly capable\nof performing complex tasks such as accurately responding to user queries, solving math problems,\nand generating code. In particular, AI agents , systems that can perceive and act upon the external\nenvironment, have recently received ever-increasing research focus. They are moving towards\nperforming complex tasks such as developing software (Jimenez et al., 2024), navigating real-world\nwebsites (Zhou et al., 2023a), doing household chores (Ahn et al., 2022), or even performing scientific\nresearch (Boiko et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024a).\nAs AI agents become capable of tackling complex problems, their development and evaluation have\nalso become challenging. There are numerous recent efforts in creating open-source frameworks that\nfacilitate the development of agents (Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023). These\nagent frameworks generally include: 1) interfaces through which agents interact with the world\n(such as JSON-based function calls or code execution), 2) environments in which agents operate,\nand 3) interaction mechanisms for human-agent or agent-agent communication. These frameworks\nstreamline and ease the development process in various ways (Tab. 1, \u00a7C).\n1arXiv:2407.16741v2  [cs.SE]  4 Oct 2024\n\n=== PAGE 2 ===\n\nPreprint.\nFigure 1: OpenHands User Interface (UI, \u00a7D) allows users to view files, check executed bash\ncommands/Python code, observe the agent\u2019s browser activity, and directly interact with the agent.\nWhen designing AI agents, we can also consider how human interacts with the world. The most\npowerful way in which humans currently interact with the world is through software \u2013 software\npowers every aspect of our life, supporting everything from the logistics for basic needs to the\nadvancement of science, technology, and AI itself. Given the power of software, as well as the\nexisting tooling around its efficient development, use, and deployment, it provides the ideal interface\nfor AI agents to interact with the world in complex ways. However, building agents that can effectively\ndevelop software comes with its own unique challenges. How can we enable agents to effectively\ncreate and modify code in complex software systems ? How can we provide them with tools to gather\ninformation on-the-fly to debug problems or gather task-requisite information? How can we ensure\nthat development is safe and avoids negative side effects on the users\u2019 systems?\nIn this paper, we introduce OpenHands ( f.k.a. OpenDevin), a community-driven platform designed for\nthe development of generalist and specialist AI agents that interact with the world through software.1\nIt features:\n(1)Aninteraction mechanism which allows user interfaces, agents, and environments to interact\nthrough an event stream architecture that is powerful and flexible (\u00a72.1).\n(2)Aruntime environment that consists of a docker-sandboxed operating system with a bash shell,\na web browser, and IPython server that the agents can interact with (\u00a72.2).\n(3)Aninterface allowing the agent to interact with the environment in a manner similar to actual\nsoftware engineers (\u00a72.3). We provide the capability for agents to a) create and edit complex\nsoftware, b) execute arbitrary code in the sandbox, and c) browse websites to collect information.\n(4)Multi-agent delegation , allowing multiple specialized agents to work together (\u00a72.4).\n(5)Evaluation framework , facilitating the evaluation of agents across a wide range of tasks (\u00a74).\nImportantly, OpenHands is not just a conceptual framework, but it also includes a comprehensive\nand immediately usable implementation of agents, environments, and evaluations. As of this writing,\nOpenHands includes an agent hub with over 10 implemented agents (\u00a73), including a strong generalist\nagent implemented based on the CodeAct architecture (Wang et al., 2024a), with additions for web\nbrowsing (ServiceNow) and code editing specialists (Yang et al., 2024). Interaction with users is\n1While initially inspired by AI software engineer Devin (Cognition.ai), OpenHands has quickly evolved to\nsupport much wider range of applications beyond software engineering through diverse community contributions.\n2\n\n=== PAGE 3 ===\n\nPreprint.\nA g e n tp r o d u c e  n e w  a c t i o n[ 1 ]  M e s s a g e  ( s o u r c e = u s e r )\nC a n  y o u  c r e a t e  a  l i s t  o f  n u m b e r s  f r o m  1  t o  1 0 ,  a n d\nc r e a t e  a  w e b  p a g e  t o  d i s p l a y  t h e m  a t  p o r t  5 0 0 0 ?[ 2 ]  I P y t h o n R u n C e l l A c t i o n  ( s o u r c e = a g e n t )\nS u r e !

Furthermore, the evaluation framework currently supports 15\nbenchmarks, which we use to evaluate our agents (\u00a74).\nReleased under a permissive MIT license allowing commercial use, OpenHands is poised to support\na diverse array of research and real-world applications across academia and industry. OpenHands\nhas gained significant traction, with 32K GitHub stars and more than 2.1K contributions from over\n188 contributors. We envision OpenHands as a catalyst for future research innovations and diverse\napplications driven by a broad community of practitioners.\n2 O PENHANDS ARCHITECTURE\nWe next describe using OpenHands in detail. In particular, we discuss 1) how to define and implement\nan agent (\u00a72.1), 2) how each action execution leads to an observation (\u00a72.2), 3) how to reliably\nmanage and extend commonly used skills for agents (\u00a72.3), and 4) how to compose multiple agents\ntogether for task solving (\u00a72.4). Fig. 2 provides an overview.\n2.1 A GENT DEFINITION AND IMPLEMENTATION\nAnagent can perceive the state of the environment ( e.g., prior actions and observations) and produce\nanaction for execution while solving a user-specified task.\nThe State and Event Stream. In OpenHands, the state is a data structure that encapsulates all\nrelevant information for the agent\u2019s execution. A key component of this state is the event stream ,\nwhich is a chronological collection of past actions and observations, including the agent\u2019s own\nactions and user interactions ( e.g., instructions, feedback). In addition to the event stream, the state\nincorporates auxiliary information for agent\u2019s operation, such as the accumulative cost of LLM calls,\nmetadata to track multi-agent delegation (\u00a72.4), and other execution-related parameters.\nActions. Inspired by CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024a), OpenHands connects an agent with\nthe environment through a core set of general actions. Actions IPythonRunCellAction\nandCmdRunAction enable the agent to execute arbitrary Python code and bash com-\nmands inside the sandbox environment ( e.g., a securely isolated Linux operating system).\nBrowserInteractiveAction enables interaction with a web browser with a domain-specific\nlanguage for browsing introduced by BrowserGym (Drouin et al., 2024). These actions were chosen\nto provide a comprehensive yet flexible set of primitives covering most tasks performed by human\nsoftware engineers and analysts. The action space based on programming languages (PL) is powerful\n3\n\n=== PAGE 4 ===\n\nPreprint.\nand flexible enough to perform any task with tools in different forms ( e.g., Python function, REST\nAPI, etc.) while being reliable and easy to maintain (Wang et al., 2024a) .\nFigure 3: Minimal example of implementing an agent in\nOpenHands.\nclass MinimalAgent :\ndefreset(self) -> None:\nself.system_message = \"You are a helpful assistant ...\"\ndefstep(self, state: State):\nmessages: list[dict[str, str]] = [\n{'role': 'system', 'content': self.system_message}\n]\nforprev_action, obs instate.history:\naction_message = get_action_message(prev_action)\nmessages.append(action_message)\nobs_message = get_observation_message(obs)\nmessages.append(obs_message)\n# use llm to generate response (e.g., thought, action)\nresponse = self.llm.do_completion(messages)\n# parse and execute action in the runtime\naction = self.parse_response(response)\nifself.is_finish_command(action):\nreturnAgentFinishAction()\nelifself.is_bash_command(action):\nreturnCmdRunAction(command=action.command)\nelifself.is_python_code(action):\nreturnIPythonRunCellAction(code=action.code)\nelifself.is_browser_action(action):\nreturnBrowseInteractiveAction(code=action.code)", "extras": {"command": "sed -n '1,220p' /tmp/openhands_extracted.txt", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "vultr", "working_dir": "/outputs", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}, {"id": 38, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T05:54:10.378931", "source": "agent", "message": "Running command: pip install reportlab --quiet", "action": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "call_pAwMLmylLVyPa4w2LdVaeCO4", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CY4HT5uF7FAMcqbtjYsMc1sh4s3o9", "created": 1762235643, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"pip install reportlab --quiet\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "call_pAwMLmylLVyPa4w2LdVaeCO4", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 477, "prompt_tokens": 13217, "total_tokens": 13694, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 448, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 8576}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.01573725, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": [{"model": "gpt-5-mini", "prompt_tokens": 13217, "completion_tokens": 477, "cache_read_tokens": 8576, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "response_id": "chatcmpl-CY4HT5uF7FAMcqbtjYsMc1sh4s3o9"}]}, "args": {"command": "pip install reportlab --quiet", "is_input": false, "thought": "", "blocking": false, "hidden": false, "confirmation_state": "confirmed"}}, {"id": 39, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T05:54:12.010576", "source": "agent", "message": "Command `pip install reportlab --quiet` executed with exit code 0.", "cause": 38, "observation": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "call_pAwMLmylLVyPa4w2LdVaeCO4", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CY4HT5uF7FAMcqbtjYsMc1sh4s3o9", "created": 1762235643, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"pip install reportlab --quiet\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "call_pAwMLmylLVyPa4w2LdVaeCO4", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 477, "prompt_tokens": 13217, "total_tokens": 13694, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 448, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 8576}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.2 -> 25.3\n[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip", "extras": {"command": "pip install reportlab --quiet", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "root", "hostname": "vultr", "working_dir": "/outputs", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}, {"id": 40, "timestamp": "2025-11-04T05:54:16.090138", "source": "agent", "message": "Running command: python3 -

Released under the MIT license, OpenHands provides a runtime (sandboxed Docker environment), an event-stream architecture for tracking actions/observations, agent abstractions, multi-agent delegation, and an evaluation framework with a suite of benchmarks.\")\n,\n('Motivation & Goals',\n\"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents that can perform complex tasks such as code generation, web navigation, and system interaction. OpenHands aims to provide a flexible, community-driven platform to: 1) make it easy to build and plug in new agents, 2) provide safe sandboxed execution for code and commands, 3) support multi-agent workflows, and 4) enable standardized evaluation across realistic tasks relevant to software engineering and web interaction.\")\n,\n('Core Architecture',\n\"OpenHands consists of three main components: 1) Agent abstractions and an agent hub for community-contributed implementations; 2) an Event Stream that chronologically records Actions and Observations, forming the agent's state; and 3) a Runtime that executes actions in a Docker sandbox (IPython, bash shell, Playwright Chromium browser). Actions include IPythonRunCellAction, CmdRunAction, and BrowserInteractiveAction, enabling agents to run code, issue shell commands, and browse web pages.\")\n,\n('Agent Model & Interaction',\n\"Agents implement a step() interface that consumes the current State (including the event history) and emits Actions. Typical agent loops construct messages for an LLM with the system instruction plus recent actions/observations, call an LLM for completion, parse the response into an Action (finish, bash, python, or browser), and submit it to the Runtime. The platform supports specialized agents (code editors, web-scrapers) and generalists (e.g., CodeAct-based agents extended with browsing and editing abilities).\")\n,\n('Runtime & Safety',\n\"The runtime executes actions inside sandboxed Docker instances to isolate side effects and protect user systems. The sandbox exposes an IPython server, a bash shell, and a browser controlled via Playwright. All action executions produce Observations that are appended to the event stream, enabling reproducibility and debugging. The platform emphasizes safety through sandboxing and by restricting the scope of agent interactions to controlled environments.\")\n,\n('Multi-Agent & Delegation',\n\"OpenHands supports multi-agent delegation: tasks can be decomposed into subtasks and assigned to specialized agents (e.g., a testing agent, a refactoring agent, a web-retrieval agent). The event stream and metadata track delegation, allowing coordination and reuse of agent skills. This facilitates complex workflows where agents collaborate to solve larger software engineering problems.\")\n,\n('Evaluation Suite',\n\"The project includes an evaluation framework and a set of 15 benchmarks spanning software engineering tasks (e.g., SWE-BENCH), web navigation (WEBARENA), and other realistic scenarios. These benchmarks allow quantitative comparison of agents on task success, cost (LLM calls), and behavior. The paper reports evaluations of over 10 implemented agents on these tasks.\")\n,\n('Key Findings & Results',\n\"In empirical evaluations, OpenHands demonstrates that agents with access to code execution and browsing tools can solve a range of challenging tasks. Multi-agent compositions and specialist agents improve performance on complex workflows. The platform also highlights failure modes (e.g., hallucinated commands, brittle web interactions) and the importance of robust environment interfaces and observation recording for diagnosing issues.\")\n,\n('Community & Reproducibility',\n\"OpenHands is a community project with substantial engagement: the repository and ecosystem invite contributions of agents, environments, and evaluations. The implementation and benchmarks are released under a permissive license, with links to code and an online benchmark dashboard. The event stream and sandboxed runtime support reproducibility of agent runs and evaluations.\")\n,\n('Limitations & Future Work',\n\"OpenHands identifies several limitations: reliance on LLM capabilities which change rapidly, brittleness in web interactions due to dynamic websites, and the need for improved safety checks and resource accounting. Future directions include richer tooling for debugging agent behavior, automatic skill discovery, stronger safety policies for real-world deployment, and expanded benchmarks to better reflect real engineering workflows.\")\n,\n('Practical Notes for Presenters',\n\"Suggested talking points: 1) Emphasize the platform goal \u2014 enabling agents to interact via software in sandboxed, reproducible ways. 2) Highlight the event stream as a central design choice for traceability. 3) Note the combination of code execution + browsing as key practical capabilities. 4) Discuss evaluation across 15 benchmarks and the community-driven nature of the project. 5) Acknowledge limitations and safety focus.\")\n]\n\nc.setFont(font_name, 12)\nfor i, (title, body) in enumerate(content_sections):\n    # Start new page for first section only if exceeding page count\n    if i>0:\n        c.showPage()\n        c.setFont(font_name, 12)\n    # Header\n    c.setFont(font_name, 14)\n    c.drawString(margin, height -
