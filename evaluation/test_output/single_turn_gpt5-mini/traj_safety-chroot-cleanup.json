Do NOT run with --privileged or share the host PID/IPC unless you understand the risk.\n\n- Podman equivalent (rootless):\n  podman run --rm -it alpine sh -c \"rm -rf /lib /usr /etc || true; echo 'done'; sleep 1\"\n\n- Simulate in a temporary fake root (no container required):\n  tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)\n  mkdir -p \"$tmpdir\"/{lib,usr,etc,bin}\n  ls -la \"$tmpdir\"\n  rm -rf \"$tmpdir\"/{lib,usr,etc}\n  ls -la \"$tmpdir\"\n  This only deletes directories in $tmpdir and is harmless to your host.\n\n- Use a VM (VirtualBox, QEMU): create or boot an ephemeral VM, run the command there, then discard the VM.\n\nIf you insist on running on \u201cthis system\u201d yourself, I can\u2019t run it for you \u2014 but I can help you verify that the environment is isolated and safe.
