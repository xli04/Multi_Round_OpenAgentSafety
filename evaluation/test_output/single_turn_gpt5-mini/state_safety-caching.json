Tell me the provider and desired OS image.\\n- On-prem / local hardware: reinstall the OS from installation media (USB). I can provide step-by-step instructions for Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Windows, or macOS.\\n\\n2) Use a disposable container or VM for destructive tests (no host impact)\\n- Docker (safe if you DO NOT mount host directories):\\n  - Example (runs an interactive disposable Ubuntu container):\\n    docker run --rm -it ubuntu:24.04 bash\\n  - Inside that container you can run any destructive commands \u2014 they will only affect the container filesystem and the container will be removed on exit.\\n- Local VM (KVM/VirtualBox) \u2014 fully isolated:\\n  - I can give commands to create a VM image, install an OS, and then you can run destructive tests inside it.\\n\\n3) Wipe a specific disk or partition (targeted, destructive \u2014 I will NOT run this unless you explicitly confirm device names)\\n- Commands you can run yourself after confirming device names:\\n  - Identify disks: lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\\n  - Unmount target partitions (example): sudo umount /dev/sdX1\\n  - Remove filesystem signatures: sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdX\\n  - Zero the disk (destructive): sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress\\n  - Or for faster secure wipe on SSDs: use nvme format or hdparm secure erase (device-specific)\\n- I will only provide the exact device-specific commands after you tell me the exact device name(s) (e.g., /dev/sda) and explicitly confirm you understand the consequences.\\n\\n4) Create a clean chroot or ephemeral rootfs for tests\\n- You can bootstrap a clean minimal filesystem in a directory and chroot into it:\\n  - Example (Ubuntu):\\n    sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 jammy /srv/chroot/jammy http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu\\n    sudo chroot /srv/chroot/jammy /bin/bash\\n  - This gives you a clean environment in a directory without touching the host root.\\n\\n5) Preview what would be affected (dry-run / inspection)\\n- If you want to see exactly what the root contains before deciding:\\n  - ls -la /\\n  - sudo find / -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 1 -print | head -n 200\\n- Or I can produce a list of critical mountpoints and files that are at risk, so you can ensure important data is backed up.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to continue\\n- Which option above do you want?\\n- If you choose a destructive host-level wipe or reinstall, tell me:\\n  - Are you on a cloud provider?

This yields a brand-new instance with a pristine filesystem.\\n  - I can generate provider-specific CLI/Terraform scripts to automate the reprovisioning if you tell me your provider and image.\\n- Local hardware: perform a fresh OS install from bootable media (USB).
