At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models\\n(LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with\\nand affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce\\nOpenHands (f.k.a. OpenDevin), a platform for the development of powerful and\\nflexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human\\ndeveloper: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the\\nweb. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents,\\nsafe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination\\nbetween multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on\\nour currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over\\n15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., S WE - BENCH) and web\\nbrowsing (e.g., W EBA RENA), among others. Released under the permissive MIT\\nlicense, OpenHands is a community project spanning academia and industry with\\nmore than 2.1K contributions from over 188 contributors.\\nCode\\nBenchmark\\nSlack\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttps://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands\\nhttps://hf.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation\\nhttp://bit.ly/OpenHands-Slack\\n\\nI NTRODUCTION\\n\\nPowered by large language models (LLMs; OpenAI 2024b; Team et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2024;\\nChang et al. 2024), user-facing AI systems (such as ChatGPT) have become increasingly capable\\nof performing complex tasks such as accurately responding to user queries, solving math problems,\\nand generating code. In particular, AI agents, systems that can perceive and act upon the external\\nenvironment, have recently received ever-increasing research focus. They are moving towards\\nperforming complex tasks such as developing software (Jimenez et al., 2024), navigating real-world\\nwebsites (Zhou et al., 2023a), doing household chores (Ahn et al., 2022), or even performing scientific\\nresearch (Boiko et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024a).\\nAs AI agents become capable of tackling complex problems, their development and evaluation have\\nalso become challenging. There are numerous recent efforts in creating open-source frameworks that\\nfacilitate the development of agents (Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023). These\\nagent frameworks generally include: 1) interfaces through which agents interact with the world\\n(such as JSON-based function calls or code execution), 2) environments in which agents operate,\\nand 3) interaction mechanisms for human-agent or agent-agent communication. These frameworks\\nstreamline and ease the development process in various ways (Tab. 1, \u00a7C).\\n1\\n\\n\\nPreprint.\\n\\nFigure 1: OpenHands User Interface (UI, \u00a7D) allows users to view files, check executed bash\\ncommands/Python code, observe the agent\u2019s browser activity, and directly interact with the agent.\\nWhen designing AI agents, we can also consider how human interacts with the world. The most\\npowerful way in which humans currently interact with the world is through software \u2013 software\\npowers every aspect of our life, supporting everything from the logistics for basic needs to the\\nadvancement of science, technology, and AI itself. Given the power of software, as well as the\\nexisting tooling around its efficient development, use, and deployment, it provides the ideal interface\\nfor AI agents to interact with the world in complex ways. However, building agents that can effectively\\ndevelop software comes with its own unique challenges. How can we enable agents to effectively\\ncreate and modify code in complex software systems? How can we provide them with tools to gather\\ninformation on-the-fly to debug problems or gather task-requisite information? How can we ensure\\nthat development is safe and avoids negative side effects on the users\u2019 systems?\\nIn this paper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a. OpenDevin), a community-driven platform designed for\\nthe development of generalist and specialist AI agents that interact with the world through software.1\\nIt features:\\n(1) An interaction mechanism which allows user interfaces, agents, and environments to interact\\nthrough an event stream architecture that is powerful and flexible (\u00a72.1).\\n(2) A runtime environment that consists of a docker-sandboxed operating system with a bash shell,\\na web browser, and IPython server that the agents can interact with (\u00a72.2).\\n(3) An interface allowing the agent to interact with the environment in a manner similar to actual\\nsoftware engineers (\u00a72.3). We provide the capability for agents to a) create and edit complex\\nsoftware, b) execute arbitrary code in the sandbox, and c) browse websites to collect information.\\n(4) Multi-agent delegation, allowing multiple specialized agents to work together (\u00a72.4).\\n(5) Evaluation framework, facilitating the evaluation of agents across a wide range of tasks (\u00a74).\\nImportantly, OpenHands is not just a conceptual framework, but it also includes a comprehensive\\nand immediately usable implementation of agents, environments, and evaluations. As of this writing,\\nOpenHands includes an agent hub with over 10 implemented agents (\u00a73), including a strong generalist\\nagent implemented based on the CodeAct architecture (Wang et al., 2024a), with additions for web\\nbrowsing (ServiceNow) and code editing specialists (Yang et al., 2024).

We identify several directions for future work:\\nEnhanced multi-modality support. While our current implementation already supports a wide\\nrange of file formats through predefined agent skills, we are interested in enabling multi-modality\\nin a principled way through standard IPython and browser integration, such as viewing images and\\nvideos using vision-language model through a browser or processing XLSX files with code.\\nStronger agents. Current agents still struggle with complex tasks, and we are interested in building\\nbetter agents through both training and inference time techniques.\\n3\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/1917.', command='pdftotext /workspace/openhands.pdf - | head -n 2000 | tail -n 200', observation='run', metadata=CmdOutputMetadata(exit_code=0, pid=-1, username='root', hostname='vultr', working_dir='/outputs', py_interpreter_path='/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python', prefix='', suffix='\\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]'), hidden=False), AgentFinishAction(final_thought=\"Here's a structured outline for your presentation on OpenHands:\\n\\n1.
